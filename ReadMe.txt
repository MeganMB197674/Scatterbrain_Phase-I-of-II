This project leverages JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a memory game called 'Scatterbrain' - which requires players
to memorize a given phrase in a set amount of time controlled by a countdown. Once the timer is up, players will be presented
with a form with drop-down menus as a quiz to test their memory. 

The site is comprised of 3 separate pages, each with their own HTML and CSS. The JS is controlled all from one file.
The site is incomplete for now!! It is currently in production for the final project for this course (CSC256 - Web Interfaces 1).

You will notice event handling for onclick, onmouseout, and onmouseover events. The program incorporates use of an array and conditions as well. 

Enjoy!
